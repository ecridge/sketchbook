TangiSynth (tangisynth.sourceforge.net)
------------------------------------------------------------------

A cross-platform, tangible synthesizer. TangiSynth uses reacTIVision
to track fiducial markers placed onto a table, responding by making
music. Currently, TangiSynth comprises of two separate applications.

INSTALLATION:
------------------------------------------------------------------

//TODO

IMPORTANT NOTE: You must keep the actual TangiSynth application
(TangiSynth.app / TangiSynth.exe / TangiSynth, depending on you OS)
in its folder (TangiSynth-<OS name>) together with all its contents.
TangiSynth will fail to load if it cannot locate its images or the
settings file.

------------------------------------------------------------------



HELP:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Included with this package is a PDF document listing the uses of
each fiducial marker. If you cannot find this document, download
it from the TangiSynth website (tangisynth.sourceforge.net).

There is also a PDF containing the actual fiducials. This is
included with reacTIVision, but it can also be downloaded from
the website.

As for the actual usage of the application, it is fairly self
explanatory and intuitive. For reference, fiducial #0 brings up
a help box, and fiducials from #20 make sounds.

Have fun!
